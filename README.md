The purpose of this website was to help me learn some web development with python and html. I used Flask to build it. Once I gather enough info, I plan to use python to do some data analysis type stuff.

The website is a way to log when you see a leaf blower (something that annoys me, check the about on the website for more).

If you have any questions please contact blower_tracker@proton.me, but please be advised that I have a pretty limited understanding how all this stuff works so I may not be able to answer some of your questions.
